# IOTdevice
an IOT device that interfaces with a SQL client to keep track of your drinks. 

Currently, running in text mode by running main.py is the most stable and complete version
The GUI mode is in beta and is unfinished. 

Development work has currently ceased but I may decide to return to the idea.
